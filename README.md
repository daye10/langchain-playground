# langchain-playground

This repo is a personal sandbox for small, practical projects I build in my free time. The idea is to learn by doing — whether it’s testing APIs, building simple automation scripts, or trying out tools like LangChain.

Some projects are based on real problems I’ve run into, others are just for fun or curiosity. They’re all meant to be lightweight, focused, and useful in some way.
